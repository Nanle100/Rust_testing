// An iterator is responsible for the logic of iterating over each item and determining when the sequence has finished. When you use iterators, you donâ€™t have to reimplement that logic yourself.

fn main(){



    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v1_iter = v1.iter();

    for val in v1_iter {
        println!("Got: {val}");
    }

}
