Reverse String CLI

This program is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that takes a string input from the user and returns the reversed version of that string. It supports multi-word strings by concatenating all arguments provided after the program name.

Usage

1. Compile the program using cargo build or run it directly with cargo run.

2. Provide a string as an argument to the program when executing it from the terminal.

EXAMPLE:
cargo run -- "her name is Sarah"

Output:
The reversed string is: haras si eman reh
