The Love of Christ

Oh, boundless love that knows no end,
A grace so pure, a heart to mend.
In every breath, in every sigh,
The love of Christ will never die.

He walked the earth in humble guise,
A servantâ€™s heart, the King of skies.
For sinners lost, for hearts astray,
His mercy paved the narrow way.

Upon the cross, He bore our shame,
He took our place, endured the pain.
With arms outstretched, He called us near,
Dispelling darkness, drying tears.

No greater love the world has known,
Than Christ who claims us as His own.
Through trials deep, through tempests wild,
He leads us home, His chosen child.

Oh, wondrous love that sets us free,
A gift of life eternally.
So let us sing, with hearts ablaze,
The love of Christ, our endless praise.
