**The Love of Christ**  

Oh, boundless love, so deep, so wide,  
A well of grace, a flowing tide.  
From Calvary’s hill, the Savior cried,  
“For all your sins, I’ve bled, I’ve died.”  

No height, nor depth, nor earthly woe,  
Can dim the love that Christ bestows.  
A shepherd kind, His care He shows,  
Through every valley, He gently goes.  

A crown of thorns, His brow adorned,  
For broken hearts, His flesh was torn.  
Yet in His pain, His love was sworn,  
To bring the lost to be reborn.  

The sinner’s shame, He bore it all,  
To lift us up from Adam’s fall.  
With open arms, He heeds the call  
Of weary souls, both great and small.  

In every trial, He’s near to stay,  
His guiding light, our steadfast way.  
Through darkest night and brightest day,  
His love endures; it will not sway.  

Oh, endless love, how sweet, how true,  
It washes clean, makes all things new.  
A gift so pure, for me, for you,  
The love of Christ, forever due.
